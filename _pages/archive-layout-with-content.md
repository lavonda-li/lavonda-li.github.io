Hi, Iâ€™m Lavonda, an M.S. candidate in Bioengineering at Stanford, graduating Spring 2026, with a prior B.A. and M.Eng. in Chemical Engineering from Cambridge (UK).

I am passionate about the intersection of medicine and technology (biotech), driven by the mission to enhance quality of life through innovative, patient-centered solutions. With a strong foundation in drug discovery and delivery, clinical research, and AI/ML applications in healthcare, I strive to accelerate medical advancements at top-tier institutions. I am also actively involved in healthcare ventures, exploring entrepreneurial opportunities to improve patient outcomes.

As a product-minded leader, I apply cross-functional collaboration, user research, and data-driven decision-making to scale impact. I currently lead a profitable startup as CEO and serve as CFO of a second venture in fundraising, overseeing ~10 direct and ~100 indirect reports. My experience spans product strategy, stakeholder alignment, and execution across startups, alumni networks, and creative productions, driving initiatives that reach thousands.

Outside of work, youâ€™ll often find me at the theater enjoying Broadway musicals or occasionally working behind the scenes in production.

Letâ€™s connect! ðŸš€ Feel free to reach out at lavonda@stanford.edu.
